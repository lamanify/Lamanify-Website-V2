        <p>Lamanify Web Services aims to provide high quality services and customer satisfaction. However, if you are unsatisfied with our services, you may request a refund within 14 days of project completion under the following terms:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Domain registrations, web hosting services, SSL certificates, stock photos, and any other third-party services are non-refundable.</li>
          <li>Refunds are only available if Lamanify has failed to deliver the agreed upon project scope and specifications. Dissatisfaction with the creative or aesthetic appearance of the website does not qualify for a refund.</li>
          <li>If you terminate an ongoing project before completion, you must pay for all expenses incurred and work completed up to that point. No refund is available for early termination.</li>
          <li>Refunds must be requested in writing within 14 days of project completion, stating the reason for dissatisfaction. Lamanify reserves the right to deny any refund request if we believe our services were delivered professionally, competently, and to specification.</li>
          <li>If approved, refunds will be issued via the original payment method within 30 days. The refund amount will depend on the amount paid, percentage of work completed, and non-refundable expenses.</li>
          <li>Lamanify makes no guarantees of business results and does not issue refunds based on the client's commercial success or lack thereof.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We aim to resolve any issues professionally and amicably. However, final refund decisions remain at the sole discretion of Lamanify management. By ordering services, you agree to this refund policy.</p>
